As you read the sermon on the mount, remember that these truths are not condemnation.
>***John 3:17*** For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.

**BIG IDEA: Itâ€™s time to grow up!**
1. Make the first move

   Seek forgiveness first, seek righteousness first
>23 So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
2. Stop pretending

   Stop pretending that you have everything figured out. Jesus's words clearly convict every human. Moses, of all humans, reflects in
>***Ecclesiastes 7:20*** "Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins."

 We don't have to pretend that we are perfect, and doing so is a barrier to God's grace.
3. Say what you mean

   Speak plainly and do what you say. It is believed that Jesus made this point to contradict the Jewish leaders of the day. In trade, when a bargain was struck, promises were made and were sworn upon by various things: the temple, the jewels of the temple, etc. There was much debate and religious commentary at the time about which oaths must be upheld and which could be broken. The point is, the technicality and legalism of the Pharisees once again flaunted the heart of the law. Say and do exactly what you mean is Jesus's standard that he is putting forth.
4. Out serve

 > ***Matthew 5:31*** But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also

 Jesus entreats us to give grace. David's (Day) words here: "can you imagine what our schools would look like if everyone tried to out serve one another". It's a good point because that's what love looks like. Eager to serve and abounding with grace.

**An eye for an eye, a look at Mosaic Law**
>***Exodus 21: 23-25*** But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

The heart of this law was to prevent blood feuds which could span generations. A theft answered with a murder could quickly spiral out of control. God's purpose was to ensure harmony among His chosen people. Much of the law reflects this purpose.
