####What does light bring?
I'll try to provide the gist beneath each section:

1. Light brings color

   In the light we can discern what is good and evil. In the darkness we are blind. 

2. Light brings Confidence

   In the dark we stumble, even in a place that's familiar to us. In the light there is certainty and confidence in the steps we take.

3. Light draws people

   People are naturally drawn to the light and human nature leads us to fear the darkness. It's the same in our day to day lives. We will avoid those who are hostile to us, gravitate to those who are friendly. Think of a time when you've met a Christian beaming with the happiness and peace of the Holy Spirit.

Action Step: Stop complaining about the dark, be the light!
Jesus has empowered you to be the light of the world with His Holy Spirit. Only the "light of the world" can take away the darkness.

####What does God say about light?

The word of the bible is the light which guides our way.
Psalms 119:105 "Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path."

Jesus is the light. Following Him, we may walk in His light, sharing His glory (Rom 8:17).
John 8:12 "Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."

We are called to be this light to the rest of the world, not by our power but by the power of Him who burns in us.
Matthew 5:14 "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."

Our light burns in order to glorify God through good works of faith.
Matthew 5:16 "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."

####What else does God say about light?
Light was only the second thing created by God. Notice it was separated from the Darkness. He spoke it into existence.
Genesis 1:3-5  'And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.'

Exodus 24:31-40 Describes the golden lampstand ( the menorah ), which was the only source of light in the tabernacle and was to be kept burning always. The menorah was adorned with almonds. The Hebrew word [almond](http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8247.htm) was "so called from its early waking out of winter's sleep". This represents the radical changing response that the light brings.
